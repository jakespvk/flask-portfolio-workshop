## Development Setup

This project is ready to run! 

You can develop in the editor of your choice. This project has a configuration for VS Code (Codium). If prompted, chose the interpreter that's defined as the default for this project (`.venv/bin/python`).

Running the program is as easy as pressing the F5 key. To get started:

- Clone this repo (if you haven't)

If you have any trouble with your local setup, you can always run it the old fashioned way: `flask run`.

Happy coding!
